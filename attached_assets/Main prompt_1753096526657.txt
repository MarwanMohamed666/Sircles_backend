**Updated Sircles App Prompt (With Feature Edits)**

Create a gated-community bilingual social app called "Sircles" (default language is English, layout is LTR).
All UI text must be implemented using an AppTexts object to support future dynamic language switching.
Layout must be structured for mobile and designed with full RTL compatibility in mind for Arabic support.

**General Requirements:**

* App name: Sircles
* Language support: Arabic (RTL) and English (LTR)
* Implement a language toggle in Settings that switches all app text between Arabic and English, without mixing
* All UI must adapt layout direction based on language (RTL for Arabic, LTR for English)
* Use Material Design with a clean and modern look

**Use Firebase for:**
